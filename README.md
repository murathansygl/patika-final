This repo contains the final project developed for Patika Bootcamp.

The contract provides an enhanced todo list where users send money to the contract and input a goal value. The money can only be retrieved if the user achieves their goal. Completing todo items adds up to their score, and once this score exceeds their goal, the money can be received back.

The idea is similar to gym membership, where users pay a subscription fee in advance. Even though we feel reluctant to go to gym, the money we paid motivates us. Similarly, this contract receives money from users and holds it until the user complete the todo items. Hopefully, thinking of losing money will motivate users.
